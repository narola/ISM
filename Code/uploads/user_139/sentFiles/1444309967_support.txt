I have opened new account and want to generate steam API key. but system gives error massage like:
"Access Denied. You will be granted access to Steam Web API keys when you have games in your Steam account." on this page: http://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
then i added some free games as well as purchase paid games.
But still it gives same error massage.
